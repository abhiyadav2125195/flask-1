    "Flask is a web framework written in Python. It is designed to be simple, lightweight, and easy to use, making it a popular choice for building web applications and APIs. Flask follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard, allowing it to work with various web servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Flask Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Flask has a minimalistic and intuitive design, making it easy to understand and get started with. Its API is straightforward, allowing developers to quickly build applications without getting overwhelmed by excessive boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask provides developers with a high degree of flexibility. It doesn't impose any specific directory structure or programming paradigms, allowing developers to structure their applications according to their preferences. This flexibility makes Flask suitable for a wide range of projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is lightweight and has a small core codebase. It doesn't require external dependencies, except for a few essential libraries. This lightweight nature results in faster startup times and better performance for Flask applications.\n",

    "\n",
    "Handling Different URLs: App routes allow you to define different URLs for different functionalities of your application. This enables you to structure and organize your application's endpoints in a logical manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESTful APIs: App routes are commonly used in Flask to build RESTful APIs. Each route corresponds to a specific resource or functionality of the API. By defining routes and associating them with appropriate functions, you can implement different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for performing operations on resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separation of Concerns: App routes help in separating different parts of your application's functionality. By assigning specific routes to specific functions, you can achieve a modular structure, making your codebase more organized and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "URL Generation: Flask provides built-in URL generation functions that can be used in templates or other parts of the application to generate URLs based on the defined routes. This allows for more dynamic and flexible navigation within the application."
